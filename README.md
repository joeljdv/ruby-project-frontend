# Ruby-project-frontend

This is the frontend used for the repo: https://github.com/joeljdv/phase-3-ruby-group-project-rack-react. Fork this repository and clone it on your computer, then on your terminal run 'npm install && npm start' this will run the app on the port http://localhost:3000. This app is how you can create, read and delete objects from the database in the backend.

This is how this application works:

1. Once the app starts  you will on a home page where you can see two buttons on the top. Home and Directors.

2. Clicking on the Directors button will load the directors page where you can see a list of all the directors in the database and a button to add a new director.

3. Clicking on one of the directors name will take a movies page where you can see the movies directed by that director, a add movie button to add a new movie to the database and associate it with that director, and an X button to delete that movie from the database.
